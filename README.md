# VDSProject_Group7
This repository contains the basic files for the class project of the course "Verification of Digital Systems"

VDSCP_Part1 -> Provide a Readme.md, in which you describe what your project does, how to build and use it and how to run the tests. This information can also be added 
later, but a simple readme should be there from the start.
